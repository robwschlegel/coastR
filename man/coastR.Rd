\description{
This package contains several functions designed to address common problems
faced in coastal oceanography.
}
\details{
The main function in this package currently is \code{\link{seqSites}}.
This function allows one to automagically organise sites along a stretch of
coastline when the coast is too convoluted to do so simply using longitude
or latitude.

There are a few other small functions included and more will be added in time.
