#' coastR.
#'
#' This package contains several functions designed to address common problems
#' faced in coastal oceanography.
#'
#' @details The main function in this package currently is \code{\link{seqSites}}.
#' This function allows one to automagically organise sites along a stretch of
#' coastline when the coast is too convoluted to do so simply using longitude
#' or latitude.
#'
#' There are a few other small functions included and more will be added in time.
